# N
A programming language by N Building with stuff like modular imports.

## Python instructions

Put all of the code into `run.n` then run `n.py`

```sh
pip install lark
python n.py
```

### Bugs:
- The python branch still needs lots of work
- Add compile time to python
- Get booleans likle `1 = 1 = 1` working in python parser
